# World Preview (autoresetter for vine seed)
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/voidxwalker)

Minecraft mod that draws a preview of the world on the loading screen during chunk generation.
- **Resets exclusively** for the vine seed
- **Not legal** for the minecraft java esition leaderboards (but I'd be surprised if you get a run with it)

## Usage

There are **0** ways the player can interact with the preview, since the mod resets the seed if it's not the vine seed. You will need to crash the game using Task Manager to end the process.
